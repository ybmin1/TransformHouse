**Responsive House Layout**

- Check out the cross-section of a house that adjusts based on the screen size! The layout and furniture arrangement dynamically change as you resize the window.
- This layout is built entirely using HTML and CSS, with no additional frameworks. Resize the screen to see how the house's layout and furniture adapt!
